added bach bourree as template / startup file, location:
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/templates/template-default.tg

key names instead of number of sharps / flats for german language file in
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_de.properties

changed keys for note duration change near the cursor arrows.
increase : ','  decrease: '-'
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/dist/tuxguitar-shortcuts.xml
i guess increase makes the notes smaller. 

todo:
put Export in top level menu???
    ->menu structure too obscure
make little "1" disappear from chord diagrams in pdf printout
    ->in case diagrams begin at zero fret
make tab decal for pdf export
documentation opens in text editor???
tuxguitar is not in the debian buster repo.... :-()

delete measures takes in the clipboard range
    ->this should also be in transpose
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/measure/TGMeasureRemoveDialog.java
...takes in measure range, i guess like this:
TGBeatRange beats = context.getAttribute(TGDocumentContextAttributes.ATTRIBUTE_BEAT_RANGE);
could take this as blueprint for transpose ;-)

save Tool values
->how is file history saved?

Transpose Patch
Guess, there's two ways to copy and paste ... the clipboard used to 
be there ever since and can be used via the menu:
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/clipboard/TGMeasureCopyDialog.java
this one does the same and is new
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar-editor-utils/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/editor/action/measure/TGPasteMeasureAction.java

hey guys,
i just tried to add the capability to transpose a range of measures .... 
realized that the paste action has transpose functionality also.
but only if copy measure dialog from the hamburger menu is called before.
actually the new select 

pasting measures makes use of the transpose tool in
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/clipboard/TGPasteDialog.java
...but it doesn't work. again uses TGActionProcessor ...
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar-editor-utils/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/editor/action/TGActionProcessor.java

just pasting in the patch from tuxguitar 1.5.4 doesn't work ;-()

obviously TGActionProcessor has changed, now contains new process method:
> 	public static void process(TGContext context, String actionName, Object ... attributes) {
> 		TGActionProcessor tgActionProcessor = new TGActionProcessor(context, actionName);
> 		for (int i = 0; i < attributes.length - 1; i += 2) {
> 			tgActionProcessor.setAttribute((String) attributes[i], attributes[i+1]);
> 		}
> 		tgActionProcessor.process();
> 	}
not sure how this affects TGTransposeAction.


OLD transpose patch:
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_en.properties
            -> added 
        tools.transpose.measures
        tools.transpose.measures-from
        tools.transpose.measures-to
        tools.transpose.apply-to-measure-range

        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/action/impl/tools/TGTransposeAction.java
            -> added attributes and logic for measure range 

        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/action/impl/tools/TGTransposeAction.java
            -> added new attributes for measure range

        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar-editor-utils/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/editor/action/TGActionProcessor.java
        contains a hashmap to make attributes available for actions...
        so the transpose action needs a new attribute ??!?!?

        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/transpose/TGTransposeDialog.java
            -> added measures selection

        where do these properties come from?
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/TuxGuitar.java
        uses
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/system/language/TGLanguageManager.java
        i think it originates here:
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_de.properties
            -> added tools.transpose.measures-from tools.transpose.measures-to

        mmmhh... UITableLayout ....is used to display the transpose dialog. But how to get in there?
        looking for a place in the code where something is inserted...

        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar-lib/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/song/models/TGSong.java
        the lines here are:
        //	public int countMeasureHeaders(){
        //		return this.measureHeaders.size();
        //	}

        ok. looking for a place where number of measures is computed... should be in the copy and paste action.
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/measure/TGMeasureCopyDialog.java
        and the line is ....
        // int measureCount = song.countMeasureHeaders();

        this is the plan:
            - get the number of measures of current song
            - display a checkbox in the transpose dialog to select 'from' and 'to' measures
            - pass these parameters to the transpose action

        ok, where to get the number of measures of the song?
        not quite sure, but this apparently gives you the actual measure...:
        // TGMeasure contextMeasure = context.getAttribute(TGDocumentContextAttributes.ATTRIBUTE_MEASURE);
        // ...
        // TGMeasure measure = songManager.getTrackManager().getMeasure(track, contextMeasure.getNumber() );

        heeeeeeere we go, transpose action found:
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/action/impl/tools/TGTransposeAction.java
        ... uses SongManager and MeasureManager to do stuff...

        looking for a place where an operation on multiple measures occurs....
        here it is, copy and paste measures:
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar-editor-utils/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/editor/action/measure/TGCopyMeasureAction.java

        make transposing multiple measures easier...?
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/transpose/TGTransposeDialog.java
            -> changed comment to "semitone selection"
        ... uses ...
        /home/ptero/eclipse-workspace/tuxguitar-1.5.4-src/TuxGuitar-editor-utils/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/editor/action/TGActionProcessor.java
