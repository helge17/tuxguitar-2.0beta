# TODO:
put Export in top level menu???
    ->menu structure too obscure
make little "1" disappear from chord diagrams in pdf printout
    ->in case diagrams begin at zero fret
make tab decal for pdf export
documentation opens in text editor???
tuxguitar is not in the debian buster repo.... :-()

delete measures takes in the clipboard range
    ->this should also be in transpose
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/view/dialog/measure/TGMeasureRemoveDialog.java
...takes in measure range, i guess like this:
TGBeatRange beats = context.getAttribute(TGDocumentContextAttributes.ATTRIBUTE_BEAT_RANGE);
could take this as blueprint for transpose ;-)

save Tool values
->how is file history saved?


## CHANGELOG:

13/07/2021
transpose tool has new option "transpose selection".

12/07/2021
added bach bourree as template / startup file, location:
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/templates/template-default.tg

key names instead of number of sharps / flats for german language file in
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_de.properties

changed keys for note duration change near the cursor arrows.
increase : ','  decrease: '-'
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/dist/tuxguitar-shortcuts.xml
i guess increase makes the notes smaller.

/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_en.properties
